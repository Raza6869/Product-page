## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

In this project I increased my confidence to carry out more complex projects. I confess that I was afraid of the “Intermediate” label on the challenges because I thought I wasn't prepared to work in this category, but now I'm going to choose the most difficult challenges to do and challenge myself too, to gain more knowledge and soft skills for my career.
